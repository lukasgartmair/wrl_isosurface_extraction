1. look for the isosurface content of the wrl file (vertex coordinates and face indices) something like

								DEF ISO0_ISO Switch {
									whichChoice 1
									choice [
										Group {
											children [
												Shape {
													appearance DEF ISO0_ISO_APP Appearance {
														material Material {
															diffuseColor 0,557 0,557 0,557
															emissiveColor 0,000 0,000 0,000
															specularColor 0,800 0,800 0,800
														}
													}
													geometry IndexedFaceSet {
														solid FALSE
														coord Coordinate {
															point [
																-0,023 -0,430 -8,479
																-1,849 -0,430 -8,045
																etc.


														coordIndex [
															0 1 2 -1
															0 3 4 -1
															2 3 0 -1
															3 5 4 -1
															etc.
														



2. subset the isosurface.wrl file once for the indices and once for the vertices with
sed -n -e '132463,133082p' isosurface.txt > iso_indices.txt both for indices and coords

3. now two different files with coords and indices
4. problem the unformatted chars are somewhere in column 130 etc.
5. important note: the decimals are separated in the file by commas -> replace by points before importing it to excel etc.
6. format with libre office reader so that everthing stands in lines 0 to 2 and can be easily read by genfromtxt

	the 4th column of coordIndex can be discarded

7. read in with genfromtext in python (vrml_reader.py)

8. write the verts and face indices to obj
9. open with blender etc. (or another obj capable program)
